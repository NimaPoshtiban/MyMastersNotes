\section{Design Methodologies}
\paragraph{}
One approach for VLSI Design is using a cost function with the required factors as the inputs of the function. The General form of the cost function can be show as (\textbf{i} is a component):\[
	\mathbf{C}\,=\,\sum_{i\,=\,1}^{N}\left(\,w_{p}\\,P_{1}\,+\,w_{D}\,\frac{L_{i}}{V_{i}(t)}+w_{A}\,A_{i}\right)
\]
Where \large{\(\mathit{C}\)} is the\textbf{ cost function} and; {\large\(P_{i}\)} is the \textbf{Power Consumption} \newline
of \textbf{component i}; \large{\(\mathit{L_{i}}\)} is length of the path for the \(i\);
\large{\(V_{i}(t)\)} is the voltage of \(i\) at time \(t\); \large{\(\mathit{A_{i}}\)} is the Area of \(i\) and, \large{\(w\)} is the weight of each factor relevant to its importance (in this simplified formula \(p\) is for power, \(D\) for delay and, \(A\) for area).\newline
Designing a cost function usually tends to become more complex and time consuming as the factors grow.\\ Thereby a proper approach is necessary to reduce the complexity, this can be achieved through \textbf{Divide and Conquer} methodology by breaking down a large chip into smaller parts and abstract away the unnecessary details of the blocks \autoref{abs_main}.
